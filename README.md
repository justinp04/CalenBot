# The Calen Bot

## What is Calen?
Calen is a discord bot programmed with the intention of allowing users to have the discord events that they are 'interested' in, have put up to their Google Calendar, and eventually other calendar applications that they use which could be:
- Yahoo Calender
- iCalender
- Et al.

## Process to use 'Calen'
The envisioned process to use 'Calen' is to have a user view a discord event and click the 'Interested' button.

Once this button is pressed, then depending on the level of implementation, either have 'Calen':
- Immediately put the event on their Calendar once initial syncing has been done
- Or have the user request Calen for a calendar file that is used in some formats and manually have the user add this to their calendars.
